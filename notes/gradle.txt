What is gradle ?
-----------------
Gradle -> Build automation tool
compile, run tests, package into jar/war, docker images, deploy and run
all these can be automated by using gradle

old tools -> Ant, maven.
Ant -> Dependency management is not there in ant, lot of xml files, steep learning curve. easy to customize
maven -> use convention over configuration. pre defined folder structure. Has inbuild dep management.
    - problem with customization
gradle -> convention over configuration, customizable using DSL. Using Groovy/kotlin. No xml. Very easy to write domain specific build file.


Why gradle ?
------------
- gradle also used in groovy, c++ projects
- supports dependency management from repositories, maven central, maven local, Jcenter, File system
- Custom dependency scope unlike maven which has fixed scope
